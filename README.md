# Data-Engineering-Spotify-AWS-Project
This is a project that demonstrates the use of different aws services to perform a ETL pipline function.
I have used different AWS services to make up a pipeline that will extract transform and load the data into aws athena for data visualisation.
This project uses the spotify dataset freely available on internet.
The services used were :
1. AWS s3 bucket to store the raw data of spotify
